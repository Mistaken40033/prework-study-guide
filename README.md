## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
I wanted a new career change, and love to get into graphic design but would like my own work to be shown. I come from the airlines counters and I was already learing the FAA Coding world. I decided it would be a new world to learn.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I wanted to show that I can do it, even if I half understood what I did but it build a bit of a courage to learn a new system
- What problem does it solve?
I've made mistakes on the Command, or ended up deleting a script.js from VS but turning back to my notes it helped me reinstate the information
- What did you learn?
It breaks down step by step, giving me a preview of what is to come. I'm use to the fast pace learning a new system, but it doesn't stop me from getting nervous.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
